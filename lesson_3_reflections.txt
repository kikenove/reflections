When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To participate in a project with other people or to show it or to have a backup of it..

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manually I have control of the changes and can avoid unexpected overlaps.
