How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
You just focus in the lines that were changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
I can compare between the version that works and the one that does not.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
Pros are less effort, cons I lose control of the logical group of changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
The idea is to have one commit per logical modification and that can affect more 
than one program.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows me the description of every commit done in the current branch in the repository.
Git diff the changes between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
I can always go back to the previous working version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
To have control on my future software developments under PHP.
