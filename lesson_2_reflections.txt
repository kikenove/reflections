What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
I use git init, which creates a subdirectory named .git where all the commited files will go.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value 
do you think it offers?
It is an intermediate area where I move the changes to my programs and from there I can commit 
one by one or a few of them grouped by logical modification to the repository

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I add all the files belonging to the same logical change and commit all them together.

When would you want to create a new branch, and when would you not?
Only if I want to do some experiments with the programs, otherwise I work only with the master
branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize these changes?
To see what changes belong to each branch so I know which ones will be commited and which not.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram 
the way we do?
It is a commit that merges the changes of two branches

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
Pros are that saves you time, cons are that is veri dangerous because it can overlap changes
made by different persons making the result unuseful.
